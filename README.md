<b>Natural language processing (NLP)</b>b> is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

<b>Text mining</b> is the process of analyzing collections of textual materials in order to capture key concepts and themes and uncover hidden relationships and trends without requiring that you know the precise words or terms that authors have used to express those concepts. Although they are quite different, text mining is sometimes confused with information retrieval. While the accurate retrieval and storage of information is an enormous challenge, the extraction and management of quality content, terminology, and relationships contained within the information are crucial and critical processes.
